Hello, there are a few explanation that i want to give you, before you start playing with the code. 
Coming from the c++ i usually make everhything by my own
so probably(i really don't know) i made a lot of function that maybe there were already.
In the differents js files, there are some short explanations of what an instruction or a function does.
There are some missing thigs that i haven't done that you could may do; Like "pacman effect" (if you exit
from the left of the screen, you appears from the other side), or when a ghost dies, its ayes moves to the center
of the map (with bfs or may not), there are so much things that you could do, hope you will have fun.
I do apologies for the comments not in english (they are i Italian),
but firstly i wasn't intent to public it on github, and now inhaven't got much time.
If you really want to know something,
chat me and i will try to explain you what you want to know as soon as possible.


Sincerely yours,
Anz0taken.
